this one is probably not for now, but this will add GREAT value to a sites SEO.
since most people are just simply too lazy to properly implement this, and cannot afford a firm which 
will actually include this in their services when doing a seo run on a website.

## how will we go about this?

we need a `handler` for each resource that can be displayed.

blog, portfolio, teammember, contact
//why would anyone share a contact page?


create the class.
loop through each provider
foreach provider, use the best possible content type available and set it
your done!

we cant program all this.. there is no way to select that best fitting type (or alter the other settings)
we should take the time to read up on all those documents, so we can learn about all the possibilities.
